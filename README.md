This is an old iOS app I made. I've decided that the code might as well be OS now. Not too useful just sitting on my hard drive.

If you have any questions, just ask!

## the app

The app was designed to help English speakers learn Mandarin Chinese. One of the most challenging aspects is learning to hear and speak the four (arguably 5) tones of Mandarin. The basic idea is that the user would look up a word or phrase in the embedded dictionary and then pronounce it into the microphone. The software would track the user's tone and display it graphically, as visual feedback.
